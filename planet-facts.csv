The Sun is a star that is in the center of the Solar System
The Sun is recognized as having the largest mass in our Solar System.
"The diameter of the Sun is 1.4 million km (870,000 miles)"
The Sun’s distance from the Earth is 150 million km (93 million miles)
"Earth orbits the Sun 365 days, yes, one year."
The Sun rotates every 25-36 earth days.
The Sun’s energy travels outwards.
The Sun’s core is composed of hot & dense gasses. It has a temperature of 15 million Kelvin(27 million°F)
"The Sun is made up of 92% hydrogen, 7% helium and the remainder of various gasses."
"The atmosphere of the Sun is composed of three areas: the photosphere, chromosphere, and solar corona."
Corona is the Sun’s outer atmosphere with temperatures that range from a few thousand kelvins to a few million kelvins.
Helmet streamers are big white regions that extend out from the Sun in which solar plasma are trapped by the magnetic field of the Sun.
Solar flares from the Sun are sudden bursts of brightness that happen in places near the sunspots.
Sunspots appear on the surface of the Sun and look dark because of the lower temperatures near it.
"The internal structure of the Sun is composed of: the inner core, radiative, core, and the radiative core."
"The inner core is the hottest part of the Sun, and can reach 27 billion°F."
A solar eclipse occurs when Earth passes the shadow of the Moon.
"A total solar eclipse occurs only during a new moon, which is when the moon sits directly between the Earth and the Sun."
"Radiations of the Sun are in two forms, electromagnetic (photons) and particle (electrons, protons, alpha particles, etc.) radiation."
"In February 1974, Skylab was the first manned spacecraft to study the Sun."
Solar flares occur when magnetic fields of the Sun come together and cause huge explosions on the Sun’s surface.
"Solar flares produce bursts of electromagnetic radiation, x-rays, ultraviolet radiation, visible light, and radio waves."
"Johann Rudolf Wolf, in 1848 developed a method to count sunspots which has been called Wolf number."
"Most ancient civilizations have based their culture on the presence of the Sun. These include the myths as developed by the following people: Egyptians (Re or Ra), Aztecs (Tonatiuh and Huitzilopochtli), Greek (Helios), Inca (Inti), and the list goes on."
"If you weigh 100 lbs, your weight on the Sun would be 2707 lbs. (multiply your actual weight by 27)"
Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System.
The orbital speed of Mercury is 47.8 km/sec (29.7 miles/sec).
"Mercury has no atmosphere and no known satellites, perhaps because of its proximity to the Sun."
"The diameter of Planet Mercury is 4,878 km (3,031 miles)."
The first visit to Mercury was a flyby made by the Mariner 10 spacecraft in 1974.
"Mercury is often identified with the Greek god Hermes, the messenger of the gods in Roman mythology."
Mercury orbits the sun once every 87.97 Earth Days.
"A day, from sunrise to sunrise, on Mercury is equivalent to 176 Earth Days."
"Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, the maximum distance from the Sun = 70 million km (43.5 million miles)."
Mercury’s minimum distance from Earth = 77 million km (48 million miles).
Mercury is known as a terrestrial planet consisting of about 70% metallic and 30% silicate material.
First it was Copernicus who noticed orbiting planet in the early 16th century; and then Galileo was the first to observe Mercury during the 17th century.
"If you weigh 100 lbs, your weight on Mercury would be 38 lbs. (Multiply your actual weight by 0.38)."
The surface of the planet is covered in craters much like those seen on Earth’s moon. This is a sign that Mercury has been geologically dormant for billions of years.
"Since Mercury’s orbit is within Earth’s orbit, it can be viewed from Earth in the early morning or the late evening, but never in the middle of the nighttime."
The planet makes three complete rotations on its axis per every two orbital revolutions.
The surface temperature of Mercury ranges from -173 to 427°C. (-279 to 800°F).
Mercury is the second densest planet after Earth.
The Hubble Space Telescope cannot view Mercury. This is because Mercury is too close to the Sun and the brightness would harm the electrical components of the telescope.
"The diameter of Venus is 12,100 km (7,522 miles)."
"The interior of Venus is composed of a central iron core and a molten rocky mantle, similar to the composition of Earth."
"The surface of Venus is very dry with flat plains, highland regions, and depressions."

Minimum distance of Venus from the Earth is 40 million km (25 million miles)
Venus is the hottest planet in the Solar System.
"Venus is one of the brightest objects in the sky, next to the Sun and Moon."
It takes 243 days for Venus to rotate on its axis.
The surface of Venus may have been formed by a lot of volcanic activity. It is said to have 167 volcanoes that measure up to 100 km across.
"If you weigh 100 lbs, your weight on Venus would be 88 lbs. (multiply your actual weight by 0.88)"
The rotation of Venus is so slow that it travels around the sun quicker than it can make one rotation on its axis. This means that Venus has a longer day than it does a year.
"Aside from planet Earth, Venus is the most explored planet. Many space probes have visited and landed on Venus to gather data."
The clouds surrounding Venus are comprised mostly of sulfuric acid.
"Studies point to the fact that Venus used to have water on it, but it dried up as the sun started letting off more energy."
Venus and Uranus are the only two planets that rotate from East to West.
"Venus has a mountain named Maat Mon that is more than 5 miles high (26,400 feet). Originally a volcano, scientists are not sure if Maat Mon is still active."

"Earths main tectonic plates: African plate, Antarctic plate, Indo-Australian Plate, Eurasian Plate, North American Plate, South American Plate, and the Pacific Plate."
"Earth has several layers with unique chemical and seismic properties: Crust (0-40 km), upper mantle (40-400 km), transition region (400-650 km), lower mantle (650-2700 km), D layer (2700-2890 km), outer core (2890-5150 km), and the inner core (5150-6378 km) from the surface."
"The Earth is not perfectly round, rather it is an oblate spheroid. This is due to the planet’s equatorial bulge."
"The magnetic poles of the Earth gradually flip flop about every 200,000 to 300,000 years."
"The deepest spot on Earth is under the ocean in the Mariana Trench at 35,813 feet below sea level."

"Phobos, one of Mars’ two moons, is gradually getting closer and closer to Mars. It is believed that it will eventually collide with the planet."
The surface of Mars is covered in canyons and valleys. This leads scientists to believe that the planet once had water on it.
"Just like Earth, both of Mars’ poles are blanketed in ice."
"Of all the volcanoes in the Solar System, Mars has the tallest. It is named Olympus Mons and it stands at 15 miles high, or three times that of Mount Everest."

Uranus is the third largest planet in the Solar System.
"The atmosphere of Uranus is composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The methane in the atmosphere absorbs red light, giving the planet a blue-green color."
Uranus is considered unusual because the planet is tipped on its side. The poles actually point towards the Sun. This is due to the fact that its magnetic field is tilted 60 degrees from the axis of rotation.
"In 1986, Voyager 2 visited Uranus, until then, little was known about this planet."
